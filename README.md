# Radar_Zone-Detection
 LD2410C Zone Detection with OLED Display and WLED Control This project utilizes the LD2410C radar sensor for zone-based presence detection and integrates it with WLED for lighting control. The system monitors movements and presence within defined zones, displays real-time status on an OLED screen, and dynamically controls WLED lighting based on detected activity.  Features: Presence Detection: Detects both stationary and moving targets using the LD2410C radar sensor. OLED Display: Displays zone status, target presence, and distance measurements. WLED Integration: Automatically turns WLED lighting on/off based on radar data. EEPROM Storage: Saves zone number and WLED IP address for persistence across device restarts. Wi-Fi Configuration: Uses WiFiManager for easy Wi-Fi and device setup through a configuration portal. Customizable Zones: Dynamically adjust the radius and number of detection zones. Components: LD2410C Radar Sensor: For presence and motion detection. ESP32: The microcontroller that handles Wi-Fi, radar communication, and WLED control. OLED Display (SSD1306): Displays real-time detection and zone information. WLED: A lighting control system controlled via Wi-Fi. Setup: Radar Setup: Connect LD2410C radar sensor to the ESP32 via specified UART pins. OLED Display: Connect the SSD1306 OLED display to the I2C bus of the ESP32. WLED: Configure the IP address of the WLED setup via the configuration portal. Wi-Fi Configuration: Hold the reset button for 5 seconds to enter WiFiManager portal and set Wi-Fi credentials, zone, and WLED IP. Usage: On successful setup, the system will continuously monitor presence within the specified zones. It will control the WLED brightness based on whether a person is detected within the radarâ€™s range. The OLED screen provides visual feedback of the zone's status, target presence, and distance. Applications: Smart Home Automation: Automatically control lighting in different rooms based on occupancy. Security Systems: Detect movement and control lighting in secure zones. Energy Efficiency: Ensure lighting is only active when someone is present in the area. Dependencies: WiFiManager: For easy Wi-Fi configuration. Adafruit SSD1306 and GFX Libraries: To drive the OLED display. HTTPClient: To control WLED over a local network.
